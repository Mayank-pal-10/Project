            Classic Soles was founded by a group of friends who grew up in the 90s and shared a deep love for the era's unique sneaker culture. From the legendary Air Jordans to the groundbreaking Nike Air Max, the 90s were a golden age for sneaker innovation and style. We believe these timeless designs deserve to be celebrated and worn once again.
